                    <p>The fourth Skyline C110 generation, released in September, 1972, inherited the unique feature of the predecessor with expanded body size. Its distinct “Surfin‘ Line” was changed to soft and elegant style. The iconic four ring-shaped taillights, modeled after a jet engine nozzle, was first adopted in this model.<br />
                    <br />
                    Stemming from the previous advertisement campaign known as the “Skyline Love”, the new “Ken & Mary's Skyline” campaign became a mega hit with its original T-shirts sales. It became a social phenomenon during the sales period of five years and the total sales of C110/C111 under the nick name of “Ken & Mary” had broken 0.66 million. <br />
                    <br />
                    This model was 2000GT, a 1974 model year car, and it was recoated in the initial image color: “Bright Blue Metallic”.</p>
