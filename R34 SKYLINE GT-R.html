                        <p>The 10th generation Skyline R34 was rolled out in 1998. The body had high rigidity to improve motion performance while securing enough interior space in a smaller body. Its highest-level performance model “GT-R” was released in 1999. “V⋅spec” was the center of talks due to higher traveling performance achieved by exclusive aero parts, specifically tuned suspensions and active LSD, and styling like a racing car.
                            V⋅spec II added in 2000 adopted carbon engine hood with *NACA duct and aluminum pedals which created spartan atmosphere. This car is V⋅spec II of the special color “Bayside Blue.”</p>
