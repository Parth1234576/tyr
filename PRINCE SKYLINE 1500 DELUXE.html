                    Skyline became a Nissan when the first performance-bred Skyline GT-R was unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1969. It was still a sedan, but it now had an inline-sixÂ engine and 160 horsepower (which was impressive for the time). From 1969 to 1972,
                    
                    the first generation Nissan Skyline was available.

The Skyline GT-R in 1969 was a touring car unlike any other.  It was inspired by the Nissan Prince R380 racing prototype, with a four-valve Dual Overhead Cam engine and four-wheel independent suspension for exceptional handling.  In its first three years of competition, the car annihilated the competition in Japan's domestic touring races, winning 52 races.
The first two-door Skyline GT-R was introduced in 1970 with a successful launch and was well-received, but a global petrol crisis and a move towards stricter emissions standards forced the Skyline GT-R to be put on the shelf for a time.
