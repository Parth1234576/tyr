On the other hand, a new model of Skyline, Model C110, was introduced in September 1972. This car was a “Skyline 2000GT-R Racing Concept” car and was exhibited at the 19th Tokyo Motor Show held in 1972 after the introduction of the new model. Its car number was 73 which suggested the participation in races of the coming 1973 season. But the Nissan works team stopped operating because of tasks such as the development of anti-pollution technology and improvement of fuel efficiency.<br>This car was fully restored by “Nissan Restoration Club” in 2007, 35 years after the unveiling, and ran at the NISMO FESTIVAL in the same year with applause and cheering.</p>
