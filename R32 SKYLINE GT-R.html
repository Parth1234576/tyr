                        <p>The eighth generation Skyline R32 was rolled out in May 1989, which became a hottest topic as the revival of “GT-R” after 16 years of discontinuation. R32 was entirely renovated from form to suspension. Sizes were reduced for high dynamic performance, which was taken favorably as “return to Skyline as it should be” by many fans. The lineup was pillared hardtop 4-door sedan and 2-door coupe.
                        This is“ GTS-t TypeM”, the hottest model as of May 1989. High cornering performance and stability achieved by 4-wheel multilink suspension was talked about a lot. “TypeM” was very popular as handy roadworthy GT-car while “GT-R” was born for touring car races and not everyone could drive it.
