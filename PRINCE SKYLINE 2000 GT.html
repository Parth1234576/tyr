                    <p>Prince Skyline 2000GT (S54B-2) rolled out in February 1965 was a more sophisticated grand touring car; in other words, the evolved Skyline GT (S54A-1) that had been rolled out in March of the previous year. With the power of 125ps, the maximum speed reached 180km/h, which made it one of the fastest domestic sport sedans. <br />
                    In order to support the high engine output, the chassis was strengthened and front disc brakes were installed along with front &amp; rear stabilizers. The combination of chic appearance and advanced technologies was phrased in the catalog as “a wolf in sheep’s skin.”
