                        <p>The 7th generation Skyline R31 was rolled out in 1985. It was in 1986, the next year, that the longed-for 2-door coupe series was added to the line. The limited edition “GTS-R” coupe with the engine output of 210ps was rolled out in 1987 as base model for Group A touring cars.<br />
                        This is the car manufactured by NME (Nissan Motorsports Europe; the activity base of NISMO in Europe). It participated in European Touring Car Championship (ETC) races in 1988 with the drivers A. Grice and W. Percy. It finished 6th in the overall category at Total 24 Hours of Spa Francorchamps, one of the Triple Crown of endurance races, driven by A. Grice, W. Percy and A. Olofsson.</p>
